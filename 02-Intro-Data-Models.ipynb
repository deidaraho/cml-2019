    "\n",
    "More terminology and key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "__\"Predictors\"__ are properties of our data records that we can learn from, and which typically are available when we want to make a prediction in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example: We would like to predict the rental price of an apartment based on its location, square footage, and number of bedrooms__\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the location, square footage, and number of bedrooms are all *predictors* because we can learn from them and we will usually know them when we want to predict a rental price of a new apartment listing in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "__\"Response\"__ is the thing we want to predict -- it's available for learning, but __not__ availabile when we want to make a prediction in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the rental price would be the \"response variable\" ... we have historical records to train from, but when we apply our model in the future, we want the model to predict the (unknown, likely) rental price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business rules & \"Priors\" (aka prior belief, prior distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many discussions of AI, as well as books and even famouse competitions (e.g., Kaggle) proceed solely via manipulating data with math, and make no reference to industry knowledge and business rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "__This phenomenon is *not* because AI is smarter than traditional business knowledge__ but rather because those AI resources are more focused in the mathematical abstractions over predictorsa. (Bayesian and some other specific modeling techniques are exceptions to this generalization.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, you most definitely want to apply your knowledge of the business domain to improve your models' accuracy, as well as save lots of time and money forcing a model to \"learn\" things that are obviously true in your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real world patterns or constraints can be applied to AI modeling and will usually improve the outcome (though we do want to be careful that we don't apply unnecessary or illegitimate assumptions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes this practice is described (or even implemented) as a \"prior distribution\" (or just \"prior\"). This refers to the distribution of data that we believe holds true before we've tried to learn from our data records. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some priors imply basic \"common sense\" -- like the idea that a crime rate or square footage can't be a negative number\n",
    "\n",
    "Others are domain-specific: e.g., considering rent in San Francisco, we might start out with the belief that every habitable 1-bedroom apartment costs more than $1500 per month. If we can bake this belief into the model prior to training, the result may better reflect real world prices. It's not magic -- it's just providing additional information to the system."

If we have some properties about a transaction, and we want to predict whether the transaction is fraudulent, that is a classification problem because the answer comes from a set of just two values: \"fraud\" or \"not-fraud.\" Handwriting recognition is also a classification problem: given a hand written character, we want to know which letter or word (from a specific set) it corresponds to.\n",

    "\n",
    "But what is a model? A model is an abstraction of a system and so can \"be\" almost anything. We're more concerned with how useful it is to us -- how well it can improve our business by making good predictions -- than the philosophy of exactly what it \"is.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### kNN\n",

    "One really simple -- and surprisingly accurate -- model is called \"k Nearest Neighbors\" or kNN for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is kNN about? \n",
    "\n",
    "It's based on the idea that one way to make a prediction for a new record is to find some records we already know about, and which are as similar as possible to the new one. In our apartment example, one way to set a price for a new apartment -- and one used by real estate agents -- is to look at \"comparables\" which are other, similar apartments.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many similar items do we look for? That's the \"k\" and you get to decide what to use for k. In some problem domains, we might look at just one or two records, especially if we have a lot of examples so we can find some that are very similar. For real estate pricing, we might want to look at more -- perhaps 20 or 30 -- depending upon how complex the market is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find the k most similar records, we might average their prices or use another formula to get our predicted price.\n",

    "In this case, the model is just all of the records we have. We don't really need to do anything with them except make sure they're converted to a form that allows us to measure \"nearest\" or \"most similar\" (which itself can be nontrivial)\n",
    "\n",
    "kNN, despite being simple, can work well ... but it is often impractical. Why? it works best when we have lots of data points with lots of variety ... and we need to keep all of those data points in order to be able to make a prediction. So it's often not compact nor fast. Put another way, it doesn't abstract or describe patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before giving up on kNN, though, let's give it a try and see an actual example.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Price will be the response variable*, while all the others are predictors.\n",

    "It turns out that not only do we need to convert them to numbers, but we often want to do that in a way that treats them as totally separate properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we consider the \"Ideal\"-ness of a diamond totally separately from the \"Premium\"-ness of that diamond, etc., and of course each diamond only has one of those properties. This is called \"one-hot encoding\" (or sometimes \"dummy variable encoding\" or \"one of k encoding\").\n",

    "## Build a Parametric Model: Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical example of a parametric model is a linear regression model. Linear regression -- which you might have done by hand on a small amount of data in high school or a college stats class -- is simple, fast, robust, and performs reasonably well for many kinds of real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, linear regression is one of the two or three most widely used algorithms in the world for data modeling.\n",

    "How does the computer (or the student) figure out where to draw that regression line? The goal is to minimize the __error__.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also notice that if the data itself does not embody a linear relationship, this approach may not work very well. Surprisingly, a lot of phenomena do have a large enough linear component that this algorithm often works. One thing that will help it fit complex data -- like your business records or our diamond sales -- is using more dimensions. That is, unlike the pictures here which just have one predictor (to make the pictures simple), we can use the same approach to calculate a response as a linear function of many dimensions. \n",
